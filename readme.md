A [django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) webapp to manage my job applications together with recruiters and team managers
===

This is a minimalistic django webapp created in order to practice and showcase my skills.
    As admin, I can add my job applications to the system, including relevant documents like CV, cover letter,
        transcript of records etc.
    Recruiters and managers from different companies can see all the details and documents of the applications to their
    company, and they can also change the status of the applications or the "next step" field.
    Recruiters can also see that applications to other companies exist and what their status is, but they cannot see the
    position or the company, or the documents of those applications.
